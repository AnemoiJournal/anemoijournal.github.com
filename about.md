<em>Anemoi</em>, a scholarly journal produced by students under the sponsorship of Dr. David Rohrbacher at New College of Florida in Sarasota, will release its next issue in May 2016. Anemoi is dedicated to publishing original critical and analytical papers from all disciplines within Classics, Medieval and Renaissance, and Early Modern Studies. Because this journal seeks to provide a voice and publication opportunities for new scholars, only undergraduate work will be considered.

We accept papers under a broad range of interdisciplinary topics within these fields, including but not limited to music, history, religion, literature, drama, philosophy, art, language, and economics. The history of pre-modern studies predisposes towards research with a focus on Europe, North Africa, and the Near East, but we welcome examinations of a broader geography, particularly in the context of Early Modern Studies.
